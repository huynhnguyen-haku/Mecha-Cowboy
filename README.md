# Mecha Hunter: Bounty

## Overview
"Mecha Hunter: Bounty" is an action-packed game set in a post-apocalyptic Wild West, where rogue AI has left the world in chaos. You play as a robotic bounty hunter, taking on dangerous missions from survivors - hunting rogue robots, recovering experimental samples, or retrieving working vehicles. With randomly generated levels, diverse enemies, and dynamic gameplay, every playthrough offers a unique challenge.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Combat**: Choose from a variety of weapons - each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Lock-on targeting and laser sights enhance precision in fast-paced battles.
  
- **Diverse Enemies**: Face melee robots, ranged attackers, and massive bosses like the fire-spitting "Flamethrower" or the hammer-wielding "Warhammer." Each enemy type requires strategic thinking to defeat.
  
- **Mission Variety**: Complete 5 mission types: elimination, core recovery, base defense, vehicle retrieval, and timed escapes.
  
- **Realistic Driving System**: Drive vehicles with unique handling (FWD, RWD, AWD), drift through obstacles, and even use vehicles as weapons. But be careful, they can explode if damaged!
  
- **Randomized Levels**: Every map is procedurally generated, ensuring no two playthroughs are the same. A navigation system with a minimap guides you to objectives.

## How to Play
1. **Choose Your Weapon**: Select your loadout before each mission. Unlock new weapons using bounty rewards or find them in-game.
2. **Complete Missions**: Hunt enemies, recover stolen cores, defend areas, retrieve vehicles, or escape under time pressure.
3. **Survive and Escape**: Reach the airplane at the end of each mission to claim your rewards and prepare for the next challenge.
4. **Tips**:
   - Use the lock-on system (right-click) for precise targeting.
